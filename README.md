As a part of this project, I worked on developing the project charter, the work break down structure and managed the allocation of resources and carried out the cost-benefit analysis for developing a mobile application for the City of Syracuse and I even utilized MS Project for the same. 
This development of this application was undertaken to replace to already established system and was done by integrating the Cityworks software.
